TASK 1: Number Game

This GitHub repository hosts a Java implementation of the classic Number Guessing Game. Challenge your guessing skills by attempting to guess a randomly generated number within the range of 1 to 100. The game offers an interactive experience with limited attempts per round and the option for multiple rounds. Your final score is based on the number of successful guesses. Clone the repository, compile the Java file, and enjoy the excitement of guessing the correct number!


TASK 2: Student Grade Calculator

This GitHub repository hosts a convenient utility for computing total marks and average percentage from subject scores (out of 100). The tool also automatically assigns corresponding grades based on the calculated average percentage. By inputting your subject marks, you can quickly obtain insights into your academic performance.


TASK 3: ATM Interface

This Java repository hosts an ATM machine simulation, encapsulated in the ATMInterface class. This class represents a fully functional ATM with a user-friendly interface that enables users to perform various financial transactions. Key features include the ability to withdraw funds, deposit money, and check account balances. The implementation also incorporates robust input validation to ensure the integrity of transactions, such as verifying sufficient account balances for withdrawals. The ATM system is seamlessly connected to the user's bank account, allowing for real-time access and modification of account balances. Additionally, the system provides clear and informative messages to users based on their selected options and the outcome of their transactions, making it an ideal reference for understanding Java programming principles related to object-oriented design and validation.
